    "## Numeric Data Types\n",
    "Every variable in Python has a \"type\". The type of a variable is based on the contents of that variable, and determines the ways in which that variable can be used. For example, we cannot perform certain operations on variables of certain types.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin our discussion of data types with the data types intended to hold numbers. Python has three numerical variable types: `int`, `float`, and `complex`. In this class, we will work only with the `int` and `float` variables.\n",
    "* An `int` variable is used to represent an integer. \n",
    "* A `float` variable is used to represent a decimal number. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss the importance of variable types in more depth later. For now, we will show how to determine a variable's type using the `type()` function."
