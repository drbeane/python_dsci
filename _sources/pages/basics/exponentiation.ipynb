    "Many programming languages and computer algebra systems use the \"carat\" symbol (`^`) for exponentiation. Python is somewhat unusual in its use of `**` for exponentiation. However, even if you are familiar with using `^` to indicate exponents, you will likely get used to Python's way of doing things quickly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Be careful, though. Python *does* use the carat operator, but to indicate a different operation called [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) (which we won't discuss here). This can be something of a pitfall because if you typed `3 ^ 5` in an attempt to calculate $3^5$, you would NOT get an error, but you would get the incorrect answer (try this on your own). If you didn't realize that your answer was wrong, that could cause some problems for you down the road. \n",
