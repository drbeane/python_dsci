    "The value of a mathematical expression can be dependent on the order in which you perform the operations that constitute that expression. To avoid ambiguity or the need for excessive use of parentheses, mathematicians have adopted a standard [order of operations](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PEMDAS.html) that should be followed when evaluating expressions. Python aheres to these same rules when evaluating expressions. "
