    "A `while` loop is similar to a `for` loop in that it is a tool used to automate a repetive task. The core difference between `while` and `for` loops is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A `for` loop executes a predetermined number of times. A `for` loop that begins with **`\"for i in range(a,b)\"`** will execute exactly once for each value of the counter `i` that falls within the given range. \n",
    "* A `while` loop executes as long as some supplied condition is true. Depending on the nature of this condition, we do not necessarily know ahead of time how many times the loop will execute. \n",

If it does, then it will step into the loop and perform the first iteration. Each time the loop executes, Python returns to the start of the loop and checks the condition again. As long as the condition evaluates to `True`, Python will continue executing iterations of the loop. If the condition ever evaluates to `False`, then Python will stop executing the body of the loop, and will move on to the next lines of code. \n",

    "\n",
    "As it turns out, anything that can be accomplished with a `for` loop can also be done with a `while` loop. However, `for` loops require fewer lines of code than a similar `while` loop, and are typically easier to read. So why would we ever use a `while` loop? As it turns out, `while` loops are a more flexible tool than `for` loops. There are some tasks that we cannot accomplish with a `for` loop, but can with a `while` loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we create a for loop, we tell the loop (either explicitly, or programmatically) how many times it will run. As soon as Python encounters a statement starting with `for`, it will know how many times that the loop will execute (assuming that no errors are encountered). On the other hand, `while` loops will continue to execute for as long as some condition is true. Python does not know how many times it will execute a `while` loop that it enounters, but it will keep doing so until the condition is no longer true. For this reason, `while` loops are well-suited for situations in which we do not know how many times the loop will need to execute, either because it would be difficult to calculate, or because the condition depends on some external factors (such as user input) that Python has no way of knowing in advance. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a somewhat superficial example, let's say that you wanted to know the smallest positive integer `n` for which $n^5 > \\left(7 n + 10 \\right)^4$. If we could mathematically solve the inequality, we could get the answer, but that is certainly not easy to do. We can, however, simply start `n` at 1, and then use a `while` loop to increment `n` for as long as $n^5 \\leq \\left(7 n + 10 \\right)^4$"

We will make an initial guess for the square root, which we will call `x`. We will divide `K` by `x`, naming the result `y`. If our guess was good, then `x` and `y` will be very close to each other, and thus close to the actual solution. If our guess was bad, we will set `x` to be equal to the average of `x` and `y`, since the true answer will have to be somewhere between these two approximations. \n",
