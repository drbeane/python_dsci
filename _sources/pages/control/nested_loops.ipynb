    "## Nested Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "For some complex tasks, it is necessary to include loops inside of other loops. This is called a **nested loop**. The simplest case of a nested loops is when we have one loop that itself contains another loop. In this case, we call the first loop that Python encounters the **outer loop**, and the loop inside of that is called the **inner loop**. Each time the outer loop runs, the entire inner loop will process, running through all of it's possible iterations. \n",
