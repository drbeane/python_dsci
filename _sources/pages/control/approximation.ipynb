    "### Example: Approximating a Square Root\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often the case in Computer science and Data Science that some value of interest is calculated by performing a sequence of better and better approximations. In these situations, we might tell our program precisely how many approximations we want it to perform (likely with a `for` loop). Alternately, we might ask our program to continue to calculate approximations until we have met some condition, such as two subsequent approximations being very near to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we will approximate the square root of `K = 7,341,234,543,244,549`. Our approach will be fairly simple. We will make an initial guess for the square root, which we will call `x`. We will divide `K` by `x`, naming the result `y`. If our guess was good, then `x` and `y` will be very close to each other, and thus close to the actual solution. If our guess was bad, we will set `x` to be equal to the average of `x` and `y`, since the true answer will have to be somewhere between these two approximations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will continue this process until `x` and `y` are within 1/10000 of each other. So that we know how many times the loop had to run, we will also create a counter `n`."
