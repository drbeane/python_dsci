    "\n",
    "**Jupyter Notebook** is an open source, browser-based, programming environment. It supports a number of of programming languages such as R, Python, and Julia, but is primarily used for writing Python code. Jupyter uses a **notebook** file format that supports the inclusion of formatted text, embedded media, and executable code all within the same document. The extension for notebook files is **.ipynb**, which stands for IPython Notebook (the original name of Jupyter Notebook). \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook has two primary components: The dashboard and the kernel. The **dashboard** is a browser-based application that you will use to create, edit, and run your notebook documents. The **kernel** is a program that serves as a bridge between the dashboard and the Python interpreter. "

    "## The Notebook Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Every notebook document created in Jupyter Notebook is a collection of **cells**. There are three types of cells that can be included in a notebook document: code cells, markdown cells, and raw cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A **code cell** contains lines of executable Python code. The output of the cell is displayed directly beneath the cell. \n",
    "* A **markdown cell** is used to create a section of formatted text. The formatting in a markdown cell is defined using the **markdown** language, which is a language designed specifically for formatting text.\n",
    "* A **raw** cell contains unformatted, mono-type, non-executable text. \n",

If the code inside the cell produces output, that output will be displayed directly beneath the cell. \n",

    "## Kernel Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel associated with a notebook document represents the Python session running behind the notebook. Any variables created by running a code cell will be stored within that Python session. The Python session will automatically be closed, and the variables within it cleared from memory, when the notebook is closed. However, there are often times when you would like to manually restart the Python session while you are actively working on it. This, and similar tasks, can be performed using commands found with the **Kernel** menu item in Jupyter Notebooks. We will describe the purpose of a few of these commands. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interrupt** will stop the kernel from processing commands. This can be useful if you have executed a code cell whose contents are taking longer to run that you had expected. The interrupt command will not reset your Python session, and will not clear any variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Restart** will reset your Python session, clearing from memory any variables that were defined within that session. The Restart command will not clear any output from the notebook. Any cells that were previously executed will still show their results, but any variables created to generate those results will no longer exist in memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Restart & Clear Output** will reset the Python session, and will clear the output from any cells that have been previously executed. In general, any time you open a notebook document that you have worked on in the past, I recommend that you start by running this command. That way there will be no confusion about whether you have executed a certain cell in this session, or in a previous session. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Restart & Run All** will reset the Python session, clear the output from any cells, and then will run every code cell in the notebook from top-to-bottom. To make sure that your code is functioning properly, I recommend that you run this command periodically. You will be required to run this command as your last step before submitting any assignment. \n"

If you do not execute them in order, from top-to-bottom, then it might be unclear to someone reading your notebook (for instance a professor) how you are getting the displayed results. The reader won't have any way of knowing what order that you executed the cells in. For that reason, you will be required to run the command **Restart & Run All** before submitting any assignment in this course. "
