    "## Escape Sequences\n",
    "An **escape sequence** is a sequence of characters that Python applies special meaning to when they are encountered in a string. Several common escape sequences are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Escape Sequence  | Result |\n",
    "|:---:|-----|\n",
    "| **`\\'`**  | Prints a single quote. |\n",
    "| **`\\\"`**  | Prints a double quote. |\n",
    "| **`\\n`**  | Inserts a newline. |\n",
    "| **`\\t`**  | Inserts a tab. |\n",
    "| **`\\\\`**  | Inserts a backslash. |\n",
    "\n",
    "For an example use case for escape sequences, assume that we want to define a variable containing the following string of characters: \n",
    "\n",
    "    He yelled, \"I've had enough!\" before storming out of the room.\n",
    "    \n",
    "As before, the presence of double quotes within the string prohibit us from being able to use double quotes to define the string. Furthermore, since the character for the apostrophe is the same as the character for a single quote, we are now no longer able to use single quotes to define our string. One solution is to use an escape sequence for the apostrophe so that Python knows to interpret it as text. "
