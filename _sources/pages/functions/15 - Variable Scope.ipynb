Some scopes will exist for the length of your python session, while others will have a limited lifetime. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scopes are arranged in a heirarchy. At the top level of this heirarchy is the **global scope**. Most objects that we create in Python will exist in the global scope. The global scope will persist for the duration of our Python session, and variables define within it are accessible from anywhere within our program. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a function is called, it creates its own **local scope** that will exist only during the time it takes for the function to execute. Any parameters used in the function, or variables created in the body of the function, will exist only in this local scope, and will disappear after the function finishes executing. To see a demonstration of this, consider the example below. \n"
