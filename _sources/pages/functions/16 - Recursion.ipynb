    "It is possible for a function to call itself. The act of a function calling itself is called **recursion**, and a function that uses recursion is referred to as **recursive**. It might not be immediately obviously what would happen if a function was to call itself, or why this might be useful. In fact, recursions can be a difficult concept to fully understand, but it is none-the-less a very powerful tool for addressing certain types of problems.  In this lesson we will discuss how recursion work. We will also provide an indication as to some of the potential uses of recursion. \n",

This is typical of recursive functions. A recursive function will generally have one or more sets of parameter values for which the function does not recurse. Such a set of parameter values is referred to as a `base case` for the function. Recursive functions should be written so as to guarantee that they will always encounter a base case. Otherwise, the function might recur infinitely.    \n",
