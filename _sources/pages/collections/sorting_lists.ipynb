    "You might be asking how to decide which of these sorting functions to use if you need to sort a list. The answer essentially boils down to whether or not you need to preserve the original list, or if you only intend to ever work with the sorted version of the list. If you need need to preserve the original order, then you should sort using `sorted()`. However, if don't need the original ordering and will only work with the sorted version of the list, then you should use `sort()`.\n",

    "Note that `reverse()` does not sort the list in descending order. It simply reverses the current order of the list. We saw previously that we can obtain an in-place sort of a list in descending order by specifying `reverse=True` when using the `sort()` method. We could also call the `sort()` method on a list to first sort the list in ascending order, and then call the `reverse()` method on the list to put the list into descending order. However, this would require two lines of code. We illustrate this technique in the cell below. "
